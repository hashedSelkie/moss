    <p>We would welcome new committee members.</p> 
    <p>The committee meets three times a year in addition to the AGM. Our main activities are to co-ordinate each year's activities on the Moss - and lead some of them too; liaise with the Mugdock Rangers and EDC's Neighbourhood Services officer about conservation work; and apply for grant funding when it's needed.</p> 
    <p>We have also been concerned with the housing development proposals that could have affected the Moss adversely.</p> 
    <p>If you would like to get involved with any of these activities, or just like to join us as a supporting committee member, we would love to hear from you.</p> 
    <p>Contact details can be found on the Contact us page or at the bottom of the page.</p>
